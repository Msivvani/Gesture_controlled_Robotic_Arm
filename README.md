# Gesture_controlled_Robotic_Hand
PHASE 1: reciever.ino & transmitter.ino

The Robotic hand mimics the human hand by getting input from a set of flex sensors through SPI communication. The flex sensors were attached to wearable glove and NRF transciever was used to establish communication between the robotic hand and the glove.
The working of the robotic hand is avalibale in the link below:

PHASE 2: ML_Model & reciever_ML.ino 

Machine learning model is used to detect the hand gesture and the robotic hand mimics the gesture.
The action of the robotic hand using ML Model is available in the link below:
